Sorollet is a monophonic additive synth written in C++.

It can be used either as an VST instrument or embedded in an stand-alone player, useful for 64k intros.

An exporter from Renoise is also included, so that songs can be composed with Renoise and exported to .h

If you have any suggestion or want to collaborate with new features/improvements, do get in touch :-)
