_______________ WHAT IS IT? 


Sorollet is a monophonic additive synth written in C++.

It can be used either as an VST instrument or embedded in an stand-alone
player, useful for 64k intros.

An exporter from Renoise is also included, so that songs can be composed
with Renoise and exported to .h

If you have any suggestion or want to collaborate with new 
features/improvements, do get in touch :-)




_______________ HOW CAN I USE IT? IS THERE ANY RESTRICTION?


The source code is placed under a GPL v3 license. Since most of the code
is based on publicly available ideas, I think it's the only way to re-pay
the generous authors who have been as kind as to publish their
contributions before.

In other words: if you release something with this code, release the source
code for all us to enjoy it and (why not?) improve it too.

Full license text is in the LICENSE file.




_______________ NO, BUT I MEAN, I HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW TO USE THIS! 
                I NEED HELP!


You can use the binary VSTi: http://github.com/sole/sorollet/downloads
Currently there's only a build for 32 bit x86 Linux systems. 
Let me know if it doesn't work in your system.

If you want to contribute a build for Windows/Mac let me know too!

If you want to make a 64k intro or something, and you're not a programmer,
then look for one ;)

Finally, if you have a general idea of how to program, these are the steps
you would follow to use this in an intro:

  1. Create the song with Renoise, using libsorollet_vsti as your only 
     source of sounds (you can have several instruments/instances, of course).
     But no samples or any other VSTi's.

  2. Save the song
  
  3. Using the processor in src/player/process.py, convert the song file
     to song.h
  
  4. Song.h contains a big float array with all the song data that the player
     needs to replay it
  
  5. Have a look at the src/player/main.cpp file, which is a demonstration of
     how to use the generated song.h file in a C++ program which plays audio
     and draws some graphics using SDL+OpenGL.
     
     Hopefully that should be enough for you to get started on this.
     
     You can even use src/player/main.cpp as the basis for your 
     intro/demo/whatever.
     
The code isn't totally optimised and it is surely missing some stuff which will
be superimportant for your intro/demo. 
So feel free to hack around, break and fix things! HAVE FUN!!
